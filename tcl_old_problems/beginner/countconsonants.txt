Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous, they are, 
except in two main situations, entirely harmless. Piranhas rarely feed 
on large animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants. 
When confronted with humans, piranhas’ instinct is to flee, not attack. 


But there are two situations in which a piranha bite is likely. The 
first is when a frightened piranha is lifted out of the water—for example, 
if it has been caught in a fishing net. The second is when the water level 
in pools where piranhas are living falls too low. A large number of fish 
may be trapped in a single pool, and if they are hungry, they may attack 
anything that enters the water.
